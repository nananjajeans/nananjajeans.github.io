 <p>Yesterday i read about Mandelbrots fractals and found it interesting. I had written a piece code a few months, may be years? before to find out if these numbers do have a recurring pattern.</p>

 <p> The first thing that came in my mind while reading about these Mandelbrot fractals were prime numbers.<p>
 
 <p> I had known about closed feedback loops for a while now and was wondering if this is a recurring pattern in itself.</p>
 
 <p> Oh thou Mandelbrot fractals!</p>
 
 <p> Totally unrelated, i am now working on a beard trimmer conundrum in my liesure time, similar to the jackfruit chips conundrum i wrote about an year ago.</p>
