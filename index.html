 <p>Yesterday i read about Mandelbrots fractals and found it interesting. I had written a piece code a few months, may be years? before to find out if these numbers do have a recurring pattern.</p>

 <p> The first thing that came in my mind while reading about these Mandelbrot fractals were prime numbers.<p>
 
 <p> I had known about closed feedback loops for a while now and was wondering if this is a recurring pattern in itself. I wonder how i didn't knew about these Mandelbrot fractals before!</p>
