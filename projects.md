There is this particular scene from the movie Meesamadhavan. That when Madhavan, the robber comes to the temple and prays to the God, temple administrator comes and asks him something ( i don't remember what exactly he asked), and Madhavan replies that if he calls, the God will come with him. This being said by a robber was considered as an intention to steal the shrine and in the later part of the story, the shrine was stolen and everyone blames it on Madhavan.
