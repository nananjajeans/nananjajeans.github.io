### Who am I?

I am nananja jeans. I write random stuff on social media. Most of my articles cover things that happen around me, or to someone whom I know much closer. There are a lot of interesting characters that I interact with on a daily basis, to whom I thank immensely for the continuous supply of ideas that I could later churn out to blog posts.

### Story behind the name

Once I left my jeans to dry out on the balcony of a flat where I used to live. After a short sleep, I went to to the balcony to take back my jeans and found it missing. The weather was stormy and the wind had blown my jeans away from the rails to the rain outside. I went down and took the wet jeans back to my apartment. Coincidentally, i created a social media account that day and when asked for the handle name, I just wrote nananja jeans. And, rest is history.

### What are my hobbies?

I love watching movies. Whenever time permits, I try to watch every single movie from the theatre. I like to see the expressions on the face of people when they say comedy rather than the words they spell.

For eg., the movie megham has this particular scene where Srinivasan ( Shanmukhan muthalali ) asks Haneefikka ( kunjikkuttan ) to bring his wife’s sister for a movie in his theatre. Kunjikkuttan told Shanmukhan that the girl isn’t willing to come to the theatre as she doesn’t have a good saree to wear.

Shanmukhan then gifts a saree to the girl and asks Kunjikkuttan to give it to her and make her come to the movies at the earliest. The girl isn’t interested and rejects the offer. Instead of returning the saree to Shanmukhan, Kunjikkuttan’s wife keeps it. Later Shanmukhan meets Kunjikkuttan at the riverside while bathing and asks him why he didn’t bring the girl to the theatre.

Kunjkkuttan lies to him that the girl didn’t like the black flowers on the saree. When asked to return the saree, he lies again that the saree was given to the flood-affected victims from Bihar. Talking about her ambitions, Kunjikkuttan conveys that the girl now wants to travel in a rocket.

Shanmukhan muthalali asks Kunjikkuttan for the price for a rocket and Haneefikka replies “ ambathi.. enikkariyilla! “. The look on his face at this point is epic. Later when asked about where he could find one, Haneefikka tells him “ bombayilonn anweshicha kittumaayirikkum” meaning rockets can be found in Mumbai.

This reminds me of another incident which happened to me while I was in college. There were these two girls always walking together. My friend had a crush on one of these girls and asked me to accompany him to reveal his love. It was an evening, and both of them were walking back to the bus stop. The guy asked the girl “ enikk ninne ishtaanu, ninakk enneyo” and the girl replied “ ishtalla”. At the same moment, he turns his face to the other girl walking with his crush and asked her as well - “ ninakko “. Situational jokes like these are very much enjoyable than those in today’s movies where the scriptwriters make a scene for a single line of age-old stale comedy. I frequently hunt for minute details like these in every movie I watch and is planning to post some later on this site.

### Why nananja jeans?

Making an online persona based on an inanimate object is not for the freedom to abuse people behind a mask. I choose this name because at the moment I was creating the account, it just happened to be so. Asking questions like did you pee’d in your pants or is it wet because you masturbated isn’t going to make me smile or grind my teeth in anger.

### The Beginning

This is it. I have aggregated some of the contents of my past online personas, thanks to people who made it possible. In addition, I will be writing new posts almost regularly, if time permits. At present, I’m trying to add some basic functionalities to the site like adding a comment box, of which I know about nothing. Glad you read this far, see you soon.
