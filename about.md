_**Who am I?**_

I am nananja jeans. I write random stuff on social media. Most of my articles cover things that happen around me, or to someone whom I know much closer. There are a lot of interesting characters that I interact with on a daily basis, to whom I thank immensely for the continuous supply of ideas that I could later churn out to blog posts.
