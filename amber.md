I usually don't wear watches. But recently i did purchase a watch - a vintage Casio FW 91.

As the name suggests, this gem was introduced way back in 1991. It's been about 27 years and this watch is still in production. Without any change in design or features, this watch is like the Nintendo GameBoy of digital watches.

It has no fancy features or trendy design as most of you might prefer. I love retro designs and wearing this watch takes me back to the 90's. bleep.. bloop.. bleep.. bloop..

It is a quartz digital watch that is pretty accurate with a tolerance level of +/- 30 seconds per month. Running on a 3-V Lithium ion cell, this watch is designed to last up to 10 years. In reality with the hourly reminder beep and alarm functions untouched, there are reports of people getting over 14 years of battery life on this one.

Used by Osama to Obama, this watch is populary called the terrorist's watch as they used this watch to be part of home brewed IEDs that will blast after a set timer.

The tiny green LED light is nothing to brag about. But it's still cool to see a then novel technology back in action these days. Although Casio has vintage electro luminiscence featured illuminator series watches around, i think i would stick with this one and buy the latter as a collectible item.

The Casio FW-91 is probably the first low budget digital watch to have a dedicated Wikipedia page. With enthusiasts modding this tiny little watch left and right, we even have NFC enabled FW 91's lurking around.

I wouldn't do anything fancy with this one though. I want to wear this to parties and movies, just like a time traveller from 90's visiting the future.
